# Even with just two accounts, you can see that this approach gets out of
#  hand quickly. First, we set three global variables for each account at 1, 2,
#  and 3. Also, every function now has an if statement to choose which set of
#  global variables to access or change. Any time we want to add another
#  account, weâ€™ll need to add another set of global variables and more if
#  statements in every function. This is simply not a feasible approach. We
#  need a different way to handle an arbitrary number of accounts.
